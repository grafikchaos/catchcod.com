<h2>The Chemistry</h2>
<p>Passengers on the Little Red Bus were all excited about the day that lay ahead. The bus was headed for a nearby state park where they were ready to enjoy a game of softball followed by a picnic.</p>
			
<p>Upon arriving at the park, the passengers drew numbers to see who would be on each of the two teams. As it turned out, one of the teams had far more natural talent for the game than the other team. As the game went on, the more talented team members focused only on their individual performances. The less skilled team backed up each others’ plays and cheered its members on for good teamwork. The final score favored the less talented team.</p>
			
<p>How does this translate into the experiences of a governing board? It is important to know and practice the roles necessary to become an effective governing board; however, it is at least equally important that board members come together and work as a team. Extraneous agendas need to be checked at the door. Terms such as teamwork, trust, communication, constructive disagreement and &quot;for the common good&quot; must be a part of the operating dynamics of a well-functioning governing board.</p>

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
	<ul class="bodyBullets">
		<li>Are all board members here for a common agenda – the best interests of the organization?</li>
		<li>Is the work of the collective board owned by the full board once a decision is reached?</li>
		<li>Is equal respect paid to the input of all board members?</li>
		<li>Do all board members cheer for and support each other?</li>
	</ul>
