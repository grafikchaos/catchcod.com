<h2>Intelligent Doubting</h2>
<p>Jerry was a very experienced bus driver who was held in high esteem by all of his passengers. One day, however, the passengers thought it strange when Jerry turned the Little Red Bus to the left when the road marker indicated that he should turn right. No one questioned Jerry's decision because of his experience and reputation&mdash;all were quiet. Jerry didn't make mistakes. Two hours and many miles later, now tired, hungry and thirsty&mdash; and lost&mdash;the passengers realized they should have drawn the mistaken turn to Jerry's attention.</p>
<p>How does this translate into the experiences of a governing board? It is the job of the governing board to be intelligent doubters. When board members have questions that are appropriate to their roles as board members, they need to raise those questions and seek clarification. Often times there is a feeling of hesitancy among board member to ask important questions because there is a fear that such questioning will show ignorance of a subject. Such questioning may also be incorrectly viewed as calling the competence of the executive director into question. No one person has all the  answers and even the most experienced leaders can benefit from the intelligent doubting offered by board members.</p>
<h3>Questions for consideration</h3>
<ul class="bodyBullets">
    <li>When board members have questions relating to policy issues, do they feel comfortable raising those questions?</li>
    <li>Is the executive leadership open to questions and does leadership view questioning as an appropriate board role?</li>
    <li>Do board members know the difference between appropriate policy questions and inappropriate administrative questions?</li>
    <li>Is executive leadership comfortable with not knowing the answers to all questions and open to finding the answers?</li>
