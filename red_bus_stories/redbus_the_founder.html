<h2>The Founder</h2>
<p>The Little Red Bus ran very well and always reached its destination on time, thanks to Carl. Carl was the very first passenger to ever board the bus and he took it upon himself to always be the one who was responsible for its operation.</p>
<p>Because Carl was so in &quot;in charge,&quot; the other passengers came to rely upon Carl for all of the answers and they &quot;went along for the ride,&quot; often times half-asleep.</p>
<p>One day Carl didn't show up for the bus trip. Everyone panicked. How could the bus possibly operate without Carl's presence and direction? No one else had the answer to important questions that kept the bus operational. The bus was suddenly paralyzed because all of the information and ownership had rested so completely with Carl.</p>
<p>How does this translate into the experiences of a governing board?  Founders with a passion for a cause are essential 
for most nonprofits in their early development; however, if founders are unable to share the organization with others and utilize their input, the organization runs a genuine risk of dying when the founder is no longer around. If the mission of the organization is important, it is essential that the mission is shared among numerous key stakeholders. Founders must be able to share ownership for the sake of the future health of the organization.</p>

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
	<ul class="bodyBullets">
		<li>Are all board members appropriately engaged so that loss of a single board member doesn't disrupt and jeopardize the work of the organization?</li>
		<li>Is there shared ownership and shared decision-making among board members that ensures that decision-making takes full advantage of the knowledge and insights of each board member?</li>
		<li>Do founders understand the need to share to ensure the continued growth and well-being of the organization when they are no longer present?</li>
		<li>Is there a plan in place to assist in this organizational life stage transition?</li>
