<h2>Maintenance and Repair</h2>
<p>
	The passengers on the Little Red Bus gathered for their annual business meeting to approve the budget for the bus for the upcoming year. After talking about all the new and exciting possible destinations in the next year &mdash; each with a cost &mdash; the driver urged the passengers to limit the number of new trips and concentrate more on spending dollars to address bus maintenance and repair issues. She pointed out that the bus needed new tires and an engine tune-up to ensure optimal operation. When faced with the exciting options of more trips or the less glamorous option of maintenance and repair, the passengers overwhelmingly voted to spend the money on the trips and forgo the funding of bus maintenance.

<p>
	Several weeks later the passengers were experiencing yet another trip to an existing destination when suddenly the bus came to a halt. The bus had a flat tire and was unable to move forward. With no dollars available for repair and no spare tire on board, the bus and its passengers were stranded.

	How does this translate into the experiences of a governing board? If a board fails to realize the need for adequate organizational infrastructure, it is possible that the operation of the entire organization may be in jeopardy. New and expanded programs are always exciting and carry with them the possibility of addressing multiple problems; however, without an adequate administrative infrastructure to support these programs' efforts, the entire organization may face the real possibility of functioning very poorly and not having the necessary reserves to address unforeseen problems.

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>

<ul class="bodyBullets">
	<li>
		Does the board understand the need for adequate organizational infrastructure?
	</li>
	<li>
		Does the board recognize the real possibility of unforeseen financial emergencies and budget in a manner that provides funds for such emergencies?
	</li>
	<li>
		Does the board recognize that as an organization grows there comes a point where financial support for infrastructure development must take priority over new program development?
	</li>
	<li>
		Do funders recognize that organizations need general operating support allowing the board to direct its resources where they best meet the needs of the organization?
	</li>
</ul>
