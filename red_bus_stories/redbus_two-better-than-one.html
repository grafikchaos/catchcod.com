<h2>Two Better than One?</h2>

<p>Ralph had been driving the Little Red Bus full time for 15 years and decided that it was time to retire. Upon reviewing the applications for his position, the search committee looked at an application in which two drivers would work as a team with each being hired on a part-time basis. The application looked interesting for a number of reasons, including 1.) In case of illness or leave for one of the drivers, a back-up would be in place; and 2.) Each of the applicants brought a different skill set to the job. Upon review of the applicants, the search committee decided to hire the two applicants for the one job. Shortly after their hiring, a feeling of confusion began to set in among the passengers. Driver George wanted the passengers to purchase a new set of tires because of what he determined to be a safety hazard. Driver Molly thought the tires were just fine and wanted the passengers to purchase a new air conditioning system for the bus. Driver George was quite demanding while Driver Molly attempted to engage the passengers in the decision making process. To whom should the passengers look for a final recommendation and what role should they play in decision making?</p>

<p>Quite frequently organizations are faced with a hiring decision which is a &quot;package deal&quot;: Two individuals would split responsibilities as the Executive Director. The case being made by the applicants is that the organization is actually getting two individual with a broad set of expertise. Can it work? Yes. However, such a situation often comes with significant limitations. Do both applicants share a common understanding of how to work with the Board? Are their styles compatible? Who has the final authority in the decision making process? Many pitfalls are possible in such an arrangement.</p>


<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
<ul class="bodyBullets">
    <li>What is the primary motivation for a team application?</li>
    <li>Are their styles compatible when working with stakeholders?</li>
    <li>Who would be the primary decision maker and representative to the Board?</li>
</ul>
