<h2>Charting the Course</h2>
<p>It's a bright sunshiny morning. The Little Red Bus has a full tank of gas and five eager passengers on board, ready for an enjoyable day trip. Ned, the driver, is behind the wheel and ready to go. First, he asks where his passengers want to go so he can chart the course for the day. To his surprise and confusion, Nancy wants to take the bus to see her sister in the next town over. Axel wants to go fishing at a nearby lake where he's been trying for years to catch Ol' Barney, the legendary largemouth bass. Bill has his sights on the nearest shopping center, while Joan and Phil really don't care where the bus goes. They're quite happy playing cards as the bus rolls along. Because of time limits, the bus can go to only one destination and the passengers have to make a group decision where that will be. After an hour of heated discussion with a few personal attacks thrown in, Ned decides to try to satisfy everyone and sets out on a contorted course hoping to make everyone happy. But, after following the zig-zag route he charted, Ned discovers that the bus has run out of gas and it sputters to a stop in the middle of the road. The day trip has ended in failure.</p>
<p>How does this translate into the experiences of a governing board? If an organization is to reach its goal &ndash; its mission &ndash; it must have a common understanding of that mission and it must make decisions based on that mission.  Energy and resources spent attempting to meet multiple and conflicting priorities result in poor outcomes. Mission creep &ndash; the tendency to broaden the mission &ndash; most often results in weakening the central purpose of the organization.</p>

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
<ul class="bodyBullets">
    <li>Is there a common mission for the organization?</li>
    <li>Do all of the board members know and understand this common mission?</li>
    <li>Are organizational decisions made on the basis of the organization's mission?</li>
    <li>If board members can't reach agreement on a key decision, are they willing to compromise for the sake of the mission of the organization or do all members feel that they need to get their own way?</li>
    <li>Are all board members actively engaged in charting the course or do some take a passive role and simply &quot;go along for the ride&quot;?</li>
    <li>Does the board send a clear and realistic message to its executive leadership regarding the direction in which the organization needs to move?</li>
</ul>
