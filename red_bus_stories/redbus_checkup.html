<h2>The Check Up</h2>
<p>All of the passengers on the Little Red Bus were excited as the bus left for its week-long journey. All had been involved in the planning process for the trip and all had agreed upon the itinerary for the trip.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, passenger excitement began to fade and turn into frustration when the bus began to experience a number of mechanical problems &mdash; the battery died, the engine overheated, and at one point the brakes began to fail.</p>
<p>What's going on here? Unfortunately while the passengers had focused their attention on the trip itself, they had failed to conduct the necessary &quot;check up&quot; on the bus itself to see that it was in good operating condition. They knew where they wanted to go; however, they had not adequately assessed the operating condition of the bus itself.</p>
<p>How does this translate into the role of a governing board of an organization? Clearly, the governing board must work with organizational leadership to identify the vision for the future of the organization &mdash; the strategic plan; however, they must also periodically assess the operating system of the organization itself &mdash; the self-assessment. Both are important.</p>
<p>For a more specific understanding of important elements of the self-assessment, one source for information is the Minnesota Charities Review Council. Its website spells out key areas for self-assessment. Other assessment tools are also acceptable.</p>

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
<ul class="bodyBullets">
	<li>Do board members understand the difference between a self-assessment and a planning process?</li>
	<li>Is each of the processes addressed on an on-going basis?</li>
	<li>Does the self-assessment lead the board to identify and prioritize areas in need of growth/attention?</li>
	<li>Is appropriate action taken to address organizational needs?</li>
</ul>
