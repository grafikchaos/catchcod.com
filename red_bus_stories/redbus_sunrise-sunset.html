<h2>Sunrise, Sunset</h2>

<p>Recently it had been noted that there were fewer paying passengers on the Little Red Bus as it traveled to its vacation destinations. Remaining passengers who had been on the bus for many trips began to get alarmed. What was the reason for the lack of paying customers? After speaking with several of the former passengers, it was learned that the Little Red Bus no longer served the needs/wants of some and they had simply stopped taking the trips. It was also learned that prospective passengers did not see the Little Red Bus as satisfying their needs. Passengers were looking for more luxury. They wanted more leg room, air conditioning and Internet access to name but three of their expectations.</p>

<p>Current passengers had a decision to make. They could keep operating the bus as it currently was and risk the possibility of losing more passengers or they could do a significant upgrade and provide more of the luxuries being sought by prospective passengers. The latter seemed to be the logical choice; however, it would require the creation of a whole new image for the Little Red Bus. This image simply was not in keeping with the mission of the Little Red Bus to provide safe and low-cost transportation for a modest amount of money. Upon review of the options identified, current passengers &mdash; because of their emotional attachment to the Little Red Bus &mdash; failed to identify what was possibly the best option of all: perhaps it was time to retire the bus. Sunsetting seemed to be an option very worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>Organizations exist to address a specific need. The stated mission identifies this need and the role that the organization will play in addressing it. What if the stated need no longer exists or what if the organization no longer has the capacity to address the need? When faced with such a situation, all too often emotions take the place of logical thinking and the organization is not allowed to sunset.</p>

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
<ul class="bodyBullets">
    <li>
        Is the need for which the organization was created still an existing need?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the organization have the capacity to adjust and change to meet this need?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are key stakeholders acting on well-grounded information or are they reaching decisions based primarily on their emotional attachment to this organization?
    </li>
</ul>
