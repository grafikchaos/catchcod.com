<h2>Who's Driving the Bus?</h2>
<p>
	It was Molly&rsquo;s first day driving the Little Red Bus and she had the normal anxieties of any first-time experience. She had been warned that the passengers didn&rsquo;t always stay in their seats and liked to hover behind the driver. Knowing that the evening&rsquo;s destination was well marked on the map in front of her, she set out on the day&rsquo;s journey. Shortly thereafter, one of the passengers told her that he knew a shortcut. Following his suggestion, Molly turned the bus down a narrow dirt road. Soon, a second passenger began to complain about the dust on the road and pleaded with the driver to return to the main road. Not wanting to irritate the passengers, Molly found a side road that she thought would lead back to the main highway. After an hour&rsquo;s travel down this road, it became obvious to all that they were lost. One passenger asked how Molly could be so stupid as to get them all lost, while another passenger demanded that she quit as the driver as soon as they reached the evening&rsquo;s destination.

	How does this translate into the functioning of a governing board? Nonprofit boards are made up of a group of individuals, each of whom has a sense of ownership of the organization. A well-functioning board will provide an opportunity for all voices to be heard and for lively discussion to take place; however, once a decision is reached the full board speaks in one voice to the executive director and moves forward as a body to address the next important issue.

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
<ul class="bodyBullets">
	<li>
		When providing direction to the executive leadership, does the board send one message or several messages,
		some of which may be in conflict with others?
	</li>
	<li>
		Is there a strategic plan in place that has been developed by the key stakeholders of the organization?
	</li>
	<li>
		Does the board give the executive leadership space to develop and implement the strategies necessary to reach the goals?
	</li>
	<li>
		Is there a designated board member &ndash; the board chairperson &ndash; identified as the primary person responsible for ongoing communication with the executive director?
	</li>
</ul>
