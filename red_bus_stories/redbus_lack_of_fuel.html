<h2>Lack of Fuel</h2>
<p>The red light on the dashboard was on and the fuel gauge indicator on the Little Red Bus showed empty &mdash; time for some gasoline! Mary drove the bus into the nearest gas station and was about to fill the tank when she realized that she had no money or credit cards in hand.</p>

<p>Time to ask the passengers on the bus to chip in so she could buy the needed gasoline.</p>

<p>The responses from the passengers on the bus ranged from &quot;Why didn’t you tell me before the trip that I would need to pay for the gas?&quot; to &quot;If I pay more than others do, I should have the best seat on the bus.&quot;</p>

<p>Frustrated by the lack of support from the passengers, Mary was forced to turn to others at the gas station to ask for their help. Their responses were very predictable. &quot;If the passengers can’t help pay for the gas, why should I?&quot;</p>

<p>As a result the bus sat and was ultimately abandoned.</p>

<h3>Questions for consideration:</h3>
	<ul class="bodyBullets">
		<li>Is a sound fundraising plan in place and implemented prior to the crisis for money?</li>
		<li>Upon joining the Board, do agency board members have a clear understanding of their role in making a financial contribution to the organization?</li>
		<li>Upon reaching out for financial support from others, can agency spokespersons point out that all board members make a financial contribution to the organization?</li>
		<li>Is all board member input considered equally important or do some board members enjoy inappropriate status because they can &quot;buy it&quot;? </li>
