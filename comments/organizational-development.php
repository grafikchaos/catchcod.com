				&quot;I have worked with Jim Storm, in a variety of situations, for several years. I treasure both
				his deep academic background and his experienced, professional demeanor. Jim enables members of a
				group to discuss an issue freely. Then, in a quiet manner, he moves the debate to a higher level
				with one or two questions which put the primary issue and alternative solutions into clear focus.
				Whenever Dr. Storm participates, I know we will emerge not only with new, creative ways to face
				challenges and opportunities, but also with a better understanding of ourselves.&quot;

				&quot;I do not know of a good way to thank Jim and Laura. I walked away from the meeting really inspired.
				I love to watch group dynamics and I have never been so skillfully coached. They are making All Americans
				out of us. I personally am humbled by their gift of help&hellip; The real fun is about to begin as we make
				this grow.&quot;

				&quot;My most recent work with Jim and Laura was extremely rewarding. Their project involved creating
				a lively, very accessible history of Loring Nicollet-Bethlehem Community Center, Inc. (LNB) as a part
				of the process of merging LNB with PPL. Jim's deep experience with LNB counted for a great deal, of course,
				but in addition the two of them brought creativity and sensitivity to the task. They talked with the right
				people in the right way, and saw the project as a way to advance the larger cause of continuing the important
				work of LNB in a different organizational context. At the same time the book they created provided an
				important and needed capstone to the wonderful experiences so many people and institutions in Minneapolis
				had with LNB over decades. It was a job well done, and I am grateful for their efforts.&quot;

			<em>&quot;I've known Jim Storm in his many roles for some 30 years. To all of these situations Jim has brought
				wisdom and extraordinary competence. He has the kind of leadership skills needed to work with people of
				varying ages, backgrounds and experiences. He's a strong manager and keeps an eye on the bottom line.
				He is compassionate and truly cares about those with whom he works. Jim is, above all, a fine man.&quot;
