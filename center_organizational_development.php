				I do not know of a good way to thank Jim and Laura. I walked away from the meeting really inspired.

			<p>
			  The Center for Organizational Development (COD) has provided professional consultation for the past 14 years 
			  in the fields of organizational development, philanthropic advising, and leadership development.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Working locally, nationally, and at the international level, COD is recognized as a premier 
			  organization to which clients turn to address issues in these areas.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Be it the need to increase organizational effectiveness, to guide the process whereby donors achieve their 
			  philanthropic objectives, or to assist leaders with their multiple and ever changing challenges, COD has an 
			  extended history of successful outcomes.
			</p>
			<p>
			  We are effective because we have been there with extensive hands-on experience coupled with a deep
			  knowledge base. Our diversity is a strength that helps us see issues through multiple lenses 
			  without being limited by our individual blind spots.
			</p>
			<p>
			  All of this is done in a manner in which COD and clients work in partnership. The result is a product 
			  owned by our clients and a process that is growth-producing, stimulating, and, very often, fun.
