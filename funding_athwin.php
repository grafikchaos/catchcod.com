        <h2 class='section-title'>Funding Guidelines</h2>
        <p class='red lead'>Effective January 1st, 2015</p>

        <h2 class='section-title'>I. Background Information</h2>

        <p>
            The Athwin Foundation &ndash; A family foundation named for <u>Ath</u>erton and <u>Win</u>ifred Bean located in the Greater Twin Cities area of Minneapolis and St. Paul funds organizations that provide services in the areas of Arts and Humanities, Education, Human Services, Environmental Enhancement,   Organizational Capacity Building and whose missions are complementary to the interests of the Trustees.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Foundation puts a priority on funding organizations rather than specific programs within organizations. Therefore, resources are directed to funded organizations in the form of general operating support. This policy clearly takes into account the need for strong and effective programs; however, the policy also reflects the belief that strong and effective governing boards and executive directors are best positioned to determine how resources are to be utilized at the organization level.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Foundation does not make multiple year grants; however, funding is continued on an annual basis for some organizations. This leaves limited opportunity for new funding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Effective January 2015, the Foundation will initiate communication with those organizations that it selects for potential funding. With very limited exception, this communication will take place during the first half of the calendar year. No letters of inquiry will be requested.
        </p>

        <p>
            All organizations receiving notification for potential funding will complete the application process as outlined below (see Application Process) and submit all material by the date identified by the Foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
            With limited exceptions, funding decisions and the distribution of grants will take place late in the calendar year.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Foundation is open to initial inquiries &mdash; email preferred &mdash; from those organizations that it has not funded in the past. A very limited number of inquiries may result in funding from the Foundation. Priority is placed on small organizations and/or organizations in Greater Minnesota.
        </p>
