        <h2 class='section-title'>I. Background Information</h2>

        <p>
            The Athwin Foundation &ndash; A family foundation named for <u>Ath</u>erton and <u>Win</u>ifred Bean
            and located in the Greater Twin Cities area of Minneapolis and St. Paul funds organizations providing
            services in the areas of Arts and Humanities, Education, Human Services, Environmental Enhancement,
            Organizational Capacity Building and charities whose missions are complementary to the interests of
            the Trustees.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Foundation puts a priority on funding organizations rather than specific programs within organizations.
            Therefore, resources are directed to funded organizations primarily in the form of general operating
            support. This policy clearly takes into account the need for strong and effective programs; however,
            the policy also reflects the belief that strong and effective governing boards and executive directors
            are best positioned to determine how resources are to be utilized at the organization level.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Foundation does not make multiple year grants; however, funding is continued on an annual basis
            for many organizations. This leaves limited opportunity for new funding.
        </p>

        <p>The Foundation strives to work in partnership with nonprofit organizations:</p>
