			<p class="quoteComment"><em>&quot;I do not know of a good way to thank Jim and Laura. I walked away from the meeting really inspired. I love to watch group dynamics and I have never been so skillfully coached. They are making All Americans out of us. I personally am humbled by their gift of help&hellip; The real fun is about to begin as we make this grow.&quot;</em></p>

      <p class="quoteComment"><em>&quot;My most recent work with Jim and Laura was extremely rewarding. Their project involved creating a lively, very accessible history of Loring Nicollet-Bethlehem Community Center, Inc. (LNB) as a part of the process of merging LNB with PPL. Jim's deep experience with LNB counted for a great deal, of course, but in addition the two of them brought creativity and sensitivity to the task. They talked with the right people in the right way, and saw the project as a way to advance the larger cause of continuing the important work of LNB in a different organizational context. At the same time the book they created provided an important and needed capstone to the wonderful experiences so many people and institutions in Minneapolis had with LNB over decades. It was a job well done, and I am grateful for their efforts.&quot;</em></p>

      <p class="quoteComment"><em>&quot;With acuity and sensitivity, Laura was able to absorb a staggering amount of information regarding an unexpected turn of events impacting the Souther Theater's institutional history and positioning within the community, and the associated complex range of concerns for the community stakeholders and board of directors. Laura was incredibly organized, which cannot be understated especially given the last-minute nature of the meeting. She arrived with handouts of the meeting's agenda, guidelines for participation and clearly-defined summaries of the issues. More importantly, she was able to to acknowledge but transcend the heated emotions in the room and help the group of nearly 300 people identify its core concerns and formulate next steps. Her deftness at keeping the discussion on track while also leaving room for the game plan to change was key in working towards resolution.&quot;</em></p>

			<p class="quoteComment"><em>"I've known Jim Storm in his many roles for some 30 years. To all of these situations Jim has brought wisdom and extraordinary competence. He has the kind of leadership skills needed to work with people of varying ages, backgrounds and experiences. He's a strong manager and keeps an eye on the bottom line. He is compassionate and truly cares about those with whom he works. Jim is, above all, a fine man."</em></p>

			<p class="quoteComment"><em>"I have worked with Jim Storm, in a variety of situations, for several years. I treasure both his deep academic background and his experienced, professional demeanor. Jim enables members of a group to discuss an issue freely. Then, in a quiet manner, he moves the debate to a higher level with one or two questions which put the primary issue and alternative solutions into clear focus. Whenever Dr. Storm participates, I know we will emerge not only with new, creative ways to face challenges and opportunities, but also with a better understanding of ourselves."</em></p>

			<p class="quoteComment"><em>"Jim is a first-rate professional. His commitment to positive, high-trust, long-term relationships starts with his superb listening skills. He offers depth of character and a wealth of experience with institutions, individuals and situations. And he provides a good measure of creativity and interpersonal skills. It all works together for constructive, durable solutions."</em></p>

			<p class="quoteComment"><em>"I have been privileged not only to observe, but also to benefit from, the professional organizational development practiced by Jim Storm. I am greatly impressed with the high respect shown him by his peers as well as his clients. Jim is a good listener, excellent analyst, and, perhaps above all, person who embodies the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct in his work. I strongly recommend him to clients who are searching for professional counseling and direction in meeting their own mission and goals."</em></p>

			<p class="quoteComment"><em>"Jim's expertise, knowledge about resources, and supportive, thoughtful manner were invaluable. He created a coaching environment that felt open and supportive while also being challenging, goal-oriented and pragmatic. I received useful, practical insight and information and felt rejuvenated and re-energized to face daily and strategic challenges. I would highly recommend Dr. Storm to anyone considering working with a coach or organizational development consultant."</em></p>
